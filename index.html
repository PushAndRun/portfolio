        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Profile</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Tilman. I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin and Paris, with a passion for technology, games and obviously the space!
        </p>

        <p>
          I am proficient in several programming languages including Go, Java, javaScript, as well as Python and holding a Bachelor of Science in Business Informatics. 
          I apply my knowledge in the field of web apps, data processing and AI tools that I deploy in the cloud.

        <h3>King of the hill chess engine</h3>
        <p>
          King of the hill is a chess variant where the player can win by moving the king into one of the four center fields. NextMagnus is a Java chess AI that plays exactly this variant. 
          It allows to use different search algorithms to find the best move, utilizes bit boards for accellerated computations on CPU level, as well as caching of examined tree branches. 
          The chess engine was created as part of a university research project in corporation with two other students. A front end to play against the engine will follow soon.

        <h3>Corral++</h3>
        <p>
          Corral++ is a serverless data processing framework written in Go that allows to execute Map-Reduce queries on large amounts of data. 
          In this experimental branch of the framework I implemented an advanced logging and collected data to gain deep insights into the impact of certain parameters.
          In the second step, I focussed on an improvement of the polling process that is required to monitor the progress of the individual map and reduce function invokations.
          I used the collected data to build ML models that are able to predict the execution time of the function. 
          These were compared with different linear polling algorithms that I implemented to find the most efficient option that reduces network traffic as well as delays.

        <h3>About this page</h3>

        <p>
          The assets for this page were crafted and animated in Blender. The rest of the magic happens in javaScript utilizing the three.js framework and some additional libraries such as three-nebula to add the special effects.
