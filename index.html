        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Profile</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Tilman. I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin and Paris, with a passion for technology, games and obviously - space!
        </p>

        <p>
          I am proficient in several programming languages such as Go, Java, javaScript, as well as Python and holding a Bachelor of Science in Business Informatics. 
          I apply my knowledge in the field of web apps, and data processing and AI tools to be deployed in the cloud.

        <h3>King of the hill chess engine</h3>
        <p>
          King of the Hill is a chess variant where the player wins by moving the king into one of four center fields. NextMagnus is a Java chess AI that plays exactly this variant. 
          It allows the use different search algorithms to find the best move; utilizes bit boards for accelerated computations on CPU level; as well as caching of examined tree branches. 
          The chess engine was created in corporation with two other students as part of a university research project. A front-end to play against the engine will follow soon.

        <h3>Corral++</h3>
        <p>
          Corral++ is a serverless data-processing framework written in Go that allows execution of Map-Reduce queries on large amounts of data. 
          In this experimental branch of the framework, I implemented an advanced logging system and collected data to gain deep insights into the impact of certain parameters.
          In the second step, I focused on an improvement of the polling process that is required to monitor the progress of the individual map and reduce function invocations.
          I used the collected data to build ML models that can predict the execution time of the function. 
          These were compared with different linear polling algorithms that I implemented, in order to find the most efficient option that reduced network traffic and delays.

        <h3>About this page</h3>

        <p>
          The assets for this page were crafted and animated in Blender. The rest of the magic happens in javaScript utilizing the three.js framework and some additional libraries such as three-nebula to add special effects.
